# Match-Three-Mobile-Game-A-B-Testing
Cookie Cats is a match-three mobile game where players progress through levels continuously. To enhance user experience and revenue, developers implemented "gates" at certain levels, requiring players to either wait or make in-app purchases to continue playing.  
A key question arose: Should the first gate be placed at level 30 or level 40? 
To answer this question, developers conducted an A/B test:

gate_30 group: First gate placed at level 30 

gate_40 group: First gate placed at level 40

The experimental data includes installation records, game rounds played, and 1-day retention and 7-day retention rates for approximately 90,000 players.
